== Bot behaviour ==
===================

== Abstract ==
To make bots process as simultaneous as possible, bots are processed through
several phases. The order of processing is important in terms of how abilities
will behave and how bots manage to interact with one another.

Ideally, bots do not alter anything that directly relates to the current bot
phase in such a way that the order of execution matter. For example, if two
bots have the ability to destroy each other this step, it should not matter
which is processed first. In practice this is difficult to implement, and as
such it is an ideal rather than a requirement.

== Phases ==
Below are the phases that a bot processes during a step.

prepareStep:
- Clear all ability bits and ability parameters
- Copy player shared bit abilities.
- Copy bot shared bit abilities.
- Perform ability prepareStep

- Updating sensor data
- Resetting input and bot components

updateCpu:
- Runs as many programs as possible on the cpu
- Run ability updateCpu (used for abilities that depend on programs)

step:
- Run ability step.
- Execute logic step for interactive components (weapons, engine,
	message passing, shields, etc.)
- Update physics
- Update collision

(postStep):
- Run ability postStep
- Execute logic postStep for interactive components.

(cleanup):
