== Bot abilities ==
===================

== Abstract ==
Abilities supplement what actions and behaviours bots can do. Abilities behave
somewhat like programs, and all active abilities run as programs on the CPU.

Passive abilities are given to bots in three places: Player data (all
bots use the owner's abilities), bot data (all bots of certain type use the
bot type's abilities), and individual data (a single bot may be allocated its
own unique abilities).


== Ability types ==
There are two base types of abilities, active and passive abilities.

Active abilities are always run as programs, and the ability for a bot to run
such a program relies on an internal bitset which denotes which programs a CPU
supports. Some active abilities will spawn a passive ability.

Passive abilities are always active for a bot. They provide special features
like, for example, reduced damage, automatic repair, or reduced reloading times.
These run like programs, but are always executed every frame.


== Ability classes ==
Abilities may also be part of one or more ability classes. These are used
to make targetting groups of abilities simpler. For example, some behaviour
may only target beneficial abilities.


== Active abilities ==
Active abilities are run as programs and behave according to their rules.

The only real distinction between what could be considered a program and what
could be considered an active ability is that the ability requires a program
ability bit to be set to make it available to the CPU, and that an ability
may execute several times during a bot's step.


== Passive abilities ==
Passive abilities will run every step, regardless of whether the bot wants to
or not.

However, passive abilities may be delayed, temporary, aborted, suspended,
or resumed during its run. If delayed the ability do not process until the
delay runs out. If temporary, the ability will only run for the given number
of steps. If aborted the ability is permanently removed (unless explicitly
denoted as a permanent). If suspended, the ability is turned idle until it is
later resumed.

Note that all of these behaviour modifiers may be overridden by the ability's
behaviour to protect itself, and anything trying to cause any modifier may
further force it to ignore the protection.

Not all passive abilities have beneficial effects for a bot, and certain
external events may modify the behaviour of the bot's passive abilities.
